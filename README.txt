This is a project to create a Swing Calendar Widgets to
be used in Swing projects. It includes a textbox widget for
entering dates, validating against possible formats, a
popup calendar dialog for selecting a date by month, year,
and day of month.

For tables there is a calendar cell render and a calendar cell
editor. 

All of these are based on Joda time library which is not include
but is required. The java date, time, and calendar classes are 
an abomination and need to be removed from all future versions.
When that happens something like Joda time will prevail. Until then
use Joda time!

Thanks
